# Analysis Code

This directory contains all analysis code and scripts for the Customer Churn project.

## Structure

Organize your code files here. Suggested structure:
- `data_preprocessing.py` - Data cleaning and preprocessing scripts
- `exploratory_analysis.py` - EDA scripts
- `modeling.py` - Machine learning models
- `visualization.py` - Visualization scripts
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code Guidelines

- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Document any external dependencies in requirements.txt

## Analysis Scripts

<!-- Add descriptions of your analysis scripts here -->
<!-- Example:
- `churn_prediction_model.py` - Trains and evaluates customer churn prediction model
- `feature_importance_analysis.ipynb` - Notebook analyzing key features driving churn
-->
