# Data Directory

This directory is for storing datasets used in the analysis.

## Note on Data Files

Due to file size limitations and privacy concerns, large data files are excluded from git tracking (see `.gitignore`).

## Structure

You can organize your data as:
- `raw/` - Original, unmodified data files
- `processed/` - Cleaned and processed data files
- `external/` - Data from external sources

## Data Description

<!-- Add descriptions of your datasets here -->
<!-- Example:
- `customer_data.csv` - Customer demographic and usage data
- `churn_labels.csv` - Customer churn labels
-->

## Accessing Data

If you're setting up this project:
1. Contact the team lead for access to the datasets
2. Place data files in the appropriate subdirectory
3. Update this README with data descriptions
